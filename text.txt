RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an AI framework that combines the strengths of traditional information retrieval systems (such as search and databases)
with the capabilities of generative large language models (LLMs)

An LLM (Large Language Model) is a type of AI that generates human-like text by learning patterns from vast amounts of data. 
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an AI architecture that enhances an LLM by combining it with an external knowledge source, 
such as a database or web page
